# recomendation_tool
 A light weigth recommendation tool for movies and shows.

 It's a first contact with recommendation algorithms and just some testing, as well as trial and error.

 **Basic structure**

 The project consists of three parts:
 1. Self written graph in C++ as well as functions to process the data.
 2. A webscraper to fill the data base with information about movies and shows.
 3. Simple Python GUI using kivy.


 **WORK IN PROGRESS**

 This project is far from finished and is continually updated. Things to come:
 - full functionality of the graph and data functions
 - working webscraper with limiting parameters (to avoid using all your memory)
 - refined GUI
 - setup scripts for different operating systems
